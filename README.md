## Week 2 - BOOTSTRAP

Dear students **Congratulations!!** you reach week two. After amazing HTML and CSS lesson, you are going to get deeper front-end understanding with the most popular CSS Framework for responsive and mobile-first webpages.

### What is bootstrap and Why?

Creating a CSS framework that is flexible, follows the latest standards and is thoroughly tested takes days of work and could become a project in itself. Most of us don’t have time to do this.

To make matters worse, with the rise of mobile devices, making responsive websites and keeping up with the latest technologies is time-consuming.
Those of you who are more organized may have developed your own set of base CSS files to use as the foundation for your projects. This method works, but let’s face it, this is not the most efficient way to do things and it is tedious.

Designers need a solid foundation that gives us almost everything a typical website would require but is flexible enough for customization. Thanks to hundreds of hours spent by some developers and companies, we now have dozens of CSS Frameworks to choose from.

Bootstrap which is developed by Twitter is an open source toolkit for building responsive websites. In other words, bootstrap is one of the easiest ways to build websites which automatically adjusts based on the device the viewer sees it in(tablet, mobile phones or desktops)
